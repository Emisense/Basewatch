# Introduction #

This is Basewatch, a Mac OS X Dashboard widget for time tracking on
37signals' Basecamp project mamangement system.

# Installation #

Download the latest version of Basewatch from [here](http://github.com/pzion/Basewatch/downloads).  Unarchive the downloaded file and then double-click the widget icon to install it in your Dashboard.

When Basewatch first starts, it will give the error "No login credentials".  You need to provide Basewatch with the URL and API token that you use to access Basecamp.  The API token can be found on the "My Info" page of Basecamp.  These values are entered on the "flip side" of the widget; click the "i" icon in the bottom-right-hand corner to access the flip side.

# Using Basewatch #

To start counting time, click the "Start" button.  You can stop and restart the
stopwatch at any point, and you can manually edit the time if you want.  Manual editing of the time
uses the "h", "m" and "s" characters as units and also allows the use of decimal points.
So, for example, you can manually enter a time of "2.75h" and it will correctly set the time to
"02h45m00s".

Once you want to track the some with a Basecamp project, select the project
from the pop-up list of projects, type in a comment for the time and click "Submit".
